# Movie Data Analytics and Prediction System

## Project Overview
The Movie Data Analytics and Prediction System is a state-of-the-art tool designed to predict IMDb scores using a diverse set of movie metadata. This project leverages the power of machine learning within a schema-less data lake environment, employing Python and SQL for robust data integration and manipulation. Our system showcases advanced feature engineering techniques and model evaluations to predict IMDb scores accurately.

## Key Components
- **Sophisticated Data Integration**: Implemented Python scripts to merge and transform data from various sources using similarity metrics such as Cosine, Jaccard, and Edit distance, creating a unified and rich dataset suitable for analysis.
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: By deriving new variables from existing metadata and utilizing statistical techniques, we enhance the predictive models' ability to capture nuances in the data.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: Utilizes Random Forest Regression, a powerful ensemble learning method known for its high accuracy. The pipeline includes rigorous training and testing phases to refine and validate the model's effectiveness.
- **Model Evaluation**: Focuses on minimizing prediction errors. We use Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as our primary metrics to measure the modelâ€™s performance and ensure its reliability in predicting IMDb scores.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.8**: For scripting and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data retrieval and management within the data lake.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter**: For interactive development and presentation of code.
